# Team Profile Generator

## Purpose
This team profile generator is designed to create a roster for a software company manager. The page display will be based on the manager's reponses to a series of prompt questions. The manager needs to clone the repository to use the team profile generator. After the user types "node index.js" or simply "node index" into the terminal, the prompt questions will appear. When all the questions are answered, an HTML file will be generated. The file will be called 'index.html.' A neat webpage will display a roster of the employees that the manager has entered into the terminal.
